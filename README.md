2. Create a class called TV and add a constructor with these parameters: channel, volume, and switch.
3. Add instance variables for each parameters.
4. Add an instance method that will turn on the tv on and off.
5. Add an instance method that will get and set the channel of tv.
6. Add an instance method that will get and set the volume of tv.
7. Add an instance method that will turn the channel of the tv up and down.
8. And an instance method that will increase or decrease the volume of tv.
9. Create another file called TestTV that will serve as the test drive program.
10. Import the TV class from Tv.py.
11. Define test drive by doing def Test_Drive().
